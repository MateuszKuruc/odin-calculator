<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The aim of the project was to build a calculator app with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The project heavily relies on the conditional statements that I was learning.</p>
<p>As an additional challenge, I implemented keyboard support to learn more about event listeners in JavaScript.</p>
